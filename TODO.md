# Bakery Project — To-do List

Status (2026-10-03): Phases 3, 4A and 4B are built and tested. Phase 4C is done except notification templates (waiting for the owner's channel decision). Phase 5A (kitchen tickets) is built, reviewed and deployed from `main`. **The 5A review fixes and Phase 5B packing and handover are in `main` (merged 2026-10-03)**; their database migrations are applied to the live project, and Vercel's Git integration (connected 2026-10-03) deploys `main` on every push. **Phase 5C (kitchen revisions) is built and tested on branch `phase-5c-kitchen-revisions`; its migration is live.** No browser click-through yet. **Next: merge 5C, set up test data, click through every screen (including the revision flow), then 5D.** Owner decision 2026-10-02: no stock or inventory tracking. See HANDOVER.md for setup, architecture, and known gaps.
Checkboxes represent actual completion, not intentions.

## Start here — next developer

1. [ ] Read [HANDOVER.md](HANDOVER.md), then PRD sections 5F, 7, 10A, and 14A.
2. [ ] Confirm in the Vercel dashboard that the first Git deployment of `main` (2026-10-03) succeeded; if no Next.js app was found, set the project's Root Directory to `web` and redeploy (HANDOVER section 2). Confirm the 5B defaults (HANDOVER section 6).
3. [ ] Get access to the Supabase project `auri-bakery` (ask the owner to invite you) and add `SUPABASE_SECRET_KEY` to `web/.env.local`.
4. [x] Code is on GitHub: `sandymandycandy/bakery-admin` (branch `main`). Clone it; get `web/.env.local` values from the owner.
5. [ ] Run the app locally and click through every admin screen in a browser (never done yet — only HTTP-level tests so far).
6. [ ] Create a staging Supabase project so tests can create bills without consuming the live bill sequence. (The SQL checks already run without one: `supabase/local/run-tests.sh`, HANDOVER section 3.)
7. [ ] Enable Leaked Password Protection (Supabase → Auth → Password security).
8. [x] Merge Phase 5A into `main` and deploy (done 2026-10-03).
9. [ ] Decide about demo-login autofill on the live site (`DEMO_*` variables; not set yet). Remove them before real data goes in (HANDOVER section 2).
10. [ ] Create the demo chef login (`npm run create-admin -- … --role chef`; needs the secret key) and assign it to kitchens; `/kitchen` needs it.
11. [x] While no real orders exist, reset the order sequence (done 2026-10-03: the first real order will be B-1001). Run SQL tests locally from now on so it stays there.

## Phase 0 — Planning and business decisions

- [x] Inspect existing workspace material without changing the prototype.
- [x] Draft [PRD.md](PRD.md) with public, admin, chef, calendar, and KOT scope.
- [x] Define the two source lists and item-based routing between two kitchens.
- [x] Document statuses, revisions, operational exceptions, and acceptance scenarios.
- [x] Create [PROJECT_RULES.md](PROJECT_RULES.md).
- [x] Expand the plan with seven operational workflows, related rules, and AC-21 through AC-27.
- [ ] Confirm business name and reuse of the existing prototype.
- [ ] Supply kitchen names and a product/variant-to-kitchen mapping table.
- [x] Confirm website ordering and call orders for the first release.
- [x] Retain Kitchen 1 and Kitchen 2 as planning placeholders; actual mapping remains open.
- [ ] Confirm pickup/delivery scope, timezone, currency, hours, and slots.
- [ ] Confirm acceptance permissions, payment/deposit policies, cancellation rules, and customer notification method.
- [ ] Confirm ready-stock handling, lead times, and production release rules.
- [ ] Confirm staff roles, kitchen devices, and printing needs.
- [ ] Set budget, expected volume, and target launch date.
- [ ] Confirm packing owner/checks, substitution consent, remake authority, and waste reasons.
- [ ] Define holding deadlines, late-pickup contact process, and uncollected-order outcomes.
- [ ] Decide launch timing for daily reconciliation and detailed bulk/custom specifications; document applicability of AC-26 and AC-27.
- [x] Split delivery into Release 1 (core loop plus admin overrides) and Release 1.1 (operational exception workflows) — v0.3 review.
- [x] Add Release 1 essentials to the PRD (section 5F), the recommended stack (10A), glossary (14A), and AC-28 to AC-36.
- [ ] Supply GSTIN, FSSAI licence, tax rates/HSN per category, and bill format; confirm with the accountant.
- [ ] Choose the Release 1 notification channel and pending-order alert time.
- [ ] Choose OTP provider (or captcha plus callback), submission limits, and deposit threshold.
- [ ] Supply veg/non-veg, eggless variants, and allergen data for every product.
- [ ] Set discount permissions/limits, daily/slot caps, ordering cut-offs, and the festival calendar.
- [ ] Confirm kitchen tablets and PIN sign-in.
- [x] Confirm the recommended stack (Next.js + Supabase + Vercel); hosting budget still open.

Exit: material business decisions recorded in PRD; unresolved choices remain explicitly marked.

## Phase 1 — Workflow and design definition

Depends on: relevant Phase 0 decisions.

Note: coding started before this phase was completed (owner's request). Screens were designed directly in code with a neutral placeholder style; walk them through with the owner before launch.

- [ ] Walk through one in-store, one call, and one online order with the owner.
- [ ] Walk through a future order, a mixed-kitchen order, a reschedule, and a cancellation after preparation starts.
- [ ] Confirm state transitions, partial quantities, packing responsibility, and handover permissions.
- [ ] Walk through daily product totals, a substitution awaiting consent, damaged-item remake, and an expired collection hold.
- [ ] Plan production summary, packing checklist, operational holds, incident register, and collection follow-up screens within KOT/Orders.
- [ ] Research public-site and operational screen references; record which choices each reference supports.
- [ ] Agree brand assets/content and a visual direction before visual implementation.
- [ ] Plan public product, checkout, confirmation, and protected status screens.
- [x] Plan admin Home, Products, two Orders lists, order detail, and Calendar screens (built directly; KOT still to plan).
- [x] Plan Counter Sale and bill/credit-note print layouts (80mm and A4) — built. Reports and the admin-override dialog still to plan.
- [ ] Plan OTP verification in checkout, notification templates, and the capacity/closure settings screens.
- [ ] Plan kitchen sign-in, active tickets, upcoming schedule, ticket details, and alerts.
- [ ] Include loading, empty, error, permission, stale-data, and mobile states in designs.
- [ ] Review screen flows against PRD acceptance scenarios.

Exit: reviewable screen/workflow specification with decisions recorded; no code required for this phase.

## Phase 2 — Technical planning

Depends on: settled order rules and initial screen/workflow specification.

Note: items marked done below are specified by the implemented migrations in `supabase/migrations/` (the SQL is the specification).

- [x] Confirm the recommended stack (PRD 10A): Next.js 16 + Supabase + Vercel. Hosting budget still open.
- [x] Specify bill numbering (gap-free per financial year), credit notes, and tax calculation (migration 0300/0310).
- [ ] Specify trusted-device registration and PIN sign-in security.
- [x] Specify shared order data, staff access, kitchen assignment, and record relationships (migrations 0100/0200).
- [x] Specify ticket generation (Phase 5): `docs/superpowers/specs/2026-09-30-kitchen-tickets-design.md`. Transactional confirmation, duplicate prevention (idempotency keys), and conflict handling (order version) are done.
- [x] Specify release scheduling, restart recovery, and alert handling (Phase 5): owner chose release on confirmation, so there is no scheduler to recover. Timezone behaviour is done (business timezone in settings; `web/src/lib/time.ts`).
- [ ] Specify live updates/reconnect behavior and audit records.
- [ ] Specify protected order tracking and settle guest versus account access.
- [ ] Specify stock allocation (blocked on PRD decision 7). Payment and balance calculations are done (`order_summaries` view).
- [ ] Specify usable-ready versus gross prepared quantities, remake links, hold flags, and packing-check invalidation after revisions.
- [ ] Define backup/restore, deployment environments, monitoring, and rollback approach.
- [ ] Map each acceptance scenario to its test approach.

Exit: implementation plan with dependencies and remaining external services/hardware identified.

## Phase 3 — Foundation and catalogue implementation

Start only after the user requests coding. Depends on: Phase 2.

- [x] Set up the Supabase project (auri-bakery, ap-south-1) and the Next.js app in `web/`.
- [ ] Set up a staging environment (separate Supabase project).
- [x] Implement staff email sign-in, admin/counter/chef roles, kitchen assignments, and RLS enforcement.
- [ ] Implement trusted kitchen devices and chef PIN switching (AC-34).
- [x] Configure two placeholder kitchens and business settings (name, contact, GSTIN, FSSAI).
- [x] Add opening hours and closures (Settings; enforced on every pickup time, 4A).
- [x] Add capacity caps and pickup windows (4C, 2026-09-28). Cut-offs dropped by owner decision.
- [x] Implement categories, products, variants (including eggless), veg/egg/allergen marks, GST rate/HSN, availability, lead times, and kitchen mapping.
- [x] Implement audit foundations (row-level audit trigger on catalogue, staff, kitchens, settings). Order snapshots come with orders.
- [x] Verify unauthorized access is denied and unmapped made-to-order variants are listed (SQL RLS checks plus 26 HTTP-level checks, 2026-09-27).
- [ ] Click through the admin forms in a browser (not yet done; the browser extension was not connected).

Exit: staff access and catalogue work reliably; AC-06 and relevant AC-09 checks pass.

## Phase 4 — Orders, calendar, and payments

Depends on: Phase 3.

- [x] Implement shared order records with IN_STORE, ONLINE, and CALL sources (4A).
- [x] Implement in-store/call entry, pending review, confirmation, rejection, and order details (4A).
- [x] Implement the two order lists and their search, filters, counts, and source badges (4A).
- [x] Implement item snapshots, GST-inclusive totals, deposits, balance, and manual refund records (4A).
- [ ] Implement ready-stock allocation where included (blocked: stock-count policy, PRD decision 7).
- [x] Implement Counter Sale quick checkout with split payments and change calculation (AC-28, 4B).
- [x] Implement manual order discounts (amount or %) with reason, attribution, and a counter-staff limit (4B).
- [x] Implement GST bills (gap-free per financial year, per-rate CGST/SGST), credit notes, and 80mm/A4 print (AC-29, 4B).
- [x] Implement due-date calendar (agenda + month) with source/kitchen/status filters (4A). Week/day views remain for 4C.
- [x] Implement window/day caps and admin overrides with reason (AC-32, staff side; `supabase/tests/capacity_logic.sql`). The website side uses `pickup_availability` in Phase 6.
- [x] Implement rescheduling, opening-hours/closure/lead-time validation, conflict detection, and cancellation history (4A).
- [x] Implement the admin-override action with mandatory reason (at least 5 characters) and timeline entry (AC-36, shared `OverridePrompt`). Kitchen acknowledgement of released-work changes comes with Phase 5.
- [ ] Implement notification templates, sent-records, and the pending-order alert (AC-31).
- [x] Verify AC-01, AC-07, AC-11, AC-17, AC-18, AC-19 (22 SQL checks in `supabase/tests/orders_logic.sql`, 29 end-to-end checks, 2026-09-27).
- [x] Verify AC-28 and AC-29 (billing SQL checks in `supabase/tests/billing_logic.sql`; HTTP checks of all rejection paths, 2026-09-27). Success paths were not run over HTTP to avoid consuming real bill numbers.
- [ ] Verify AC-32 and AC-36 in a browser. AC-10 (balance before handover) is covered at SQL level by `supabase/tests/packing_logic.sql` (H1–H7, 2026-10-03); its browser check is still to do.
- [ ] Set up a staging Supabase project so end-to-end tests can create real bills without touching the live bill sequence (see Start here).

### Phase 4C — done except notification templates

- [x] Pickup windows per weekday with limits, daily caps per category (counting orders), festival date overrides, admin override with reason (AC-32). Cut-offs dropped. **Browser click-through of Settings → Capacity and the new-order/reschedule panels still to do.**
- [x] Calendar week and day views (day view grouped by pickup window with window and category usage). **Browser click-through still to do** (no orders in the database yet).
- [x] Admin override prompt as a shared component with mandatory reason and timeline entry (AC-36).
- [ ] Notification templates: WhatsApp click-to-chat links for accepted/rejected/rescheduled/ready/cancelled, `notification_records` table, pending-order alert after N minutes (PRD 5F, AC-31).
- [x] Customer blocking and no-show recording (HANDOVER section 9; `supabase/tests/no_show_logic.sql` 26/26). Recording a no-show does not change the order's status. **Browser click-through still to do.**
- [x] Editing items on pending and confirmed orders (HANDOVER section 10; `supabase/tests/edit_items_logic.sql` 21/21). **Browser click-through still to do.** Phase 5 must turn edits to released work into acknowledged revisions.
- [x] Demo-login autofill on `/login` for admin and chef, controlled by `DEMO_*` env variables (owner allowed it in production).
- [x] First Vercel production deployment (`bakery-admin` project, manual `vercel deploy --prod` from `web/`). Git integration connected 2026-10-03: pushes to `main` deploy.

Exit: a staff-entered order remains consistent across lists, detail, calendar, and payment records.

## Phase 5 — KOT and chef workflow

Depends on: confirmed orders from Phase 4. Split into 5A (kitchen tickets, built), 5B (packing and handover), 5C (revisions after acknowledgement), 5D (chef PIN sign-in). See HANDOVER section 11.

- [x] Generate separate kitchen tickets from the relevant order items (5A; `supabase/tests/kitchen_logic.sql` 44/44).
- [x] Release on confirmation (owner decision 2026-09-30: no scheduled release); duplicate prevention via one ticket per kitchen per order.
- [x] Implement chef queues, source filters, kitchen switch, and ticket detail (5A, `/kitchen`).
- [x] Implement acknowledgement, preparation, partial quantities, readiness, and issue reporting (5A).
- [x] Derive aggregate readiness ("All kitchen items ready"; order stays Preparing until packing) (5A).
- [x] Implement basic packing confirmation with packer attribution and one-time handover recording (AC-22, basic part) (5B, 2026-10-03; `supabase/tests/packing_logic.sql` 22/22; HANDOVER section 13). No stock allocation (owner decision 2026-10-02). In `main`; defaults await the owner (HANDOVER section 6).
- [x] Fix the minor items from the 5A review: lock order, locked kitchen guard, change stamp, sign-out detection, KOT overdue tickets, and the small UI items (2026-10-03; HANDOVER section 12; `supabase/local/concurrency-kitchen.sh`).
- [x] Cancellation acknowledgements (stop-work notices) (5A).
- [x] Implement revisions to acknowledged work and preserved prepared quantities (5C, 2026-10-03; `supabase/tests/revisions_logic.sql` 26/26; HANDOVER section 14). Branch `phase-5c-kitchen-revisions`; migration live. Kitchen reassignment is not built (no flow moves items between kitchens).
- [x] Live updates and connectivity state: 10-second change stamp with Updated/Offline indicator (5A). Supabase Realtime deferred.
- [x] Implement KOT browser print/reprint (80mm) preserving ticket identity and revision; reprints say COPY (5A).
- [x] Show eggless/veg marks prominently on KOT lines (AC-33) (5A).
- [ ] Chef PIN sign-in on registered tablets (AC-34) (5D).
- [ ] Browser click-through of the chef screen, KOT page, kitchen card, print on a tablet-sized window, and the packing and handover card.
- [ ] Verify AC-02 through AC-05, AC-08, AC-09, AC-12 through AC-14, AC-16, and AC-33.

Exit: two kitchen users can complete a mixed order without duplicated work or premature readiness.

## Phase 6 — Public website and customer flow

Depends on: approved content/design and stable order handling. Catalogue content can be prepared earlier.

- [ ] Implement the public home, products, details, contact, and policy pages.
- [ ] Replace unverified claims and placeholder business data with owner-supplied content.
- [ ] Compress and resize prototype photos (WebP/AVIF, responsive sizes) before reuse.
- [ ] Show veg/egg marks and FSSAI licence number on the site.
- [ ] Implement cart, slot selection, submission, confirmation, and protected status access.
- [ ] Implement phone OTP (or captcha plus callback), rate limits, number blocking, and deposit threshold (AC-30).
- [ ] Reuse the shared order/routing rules for public orders.
- [ ] Implement explicit pending acceptance, validation, submission recovery, and duplicate protection.
- [ ] Implement customer confirmation/status messaging through the chosen channel.
- [ ] Verify public flows, mobile usability, keyboard access, AC-07, AC-15, AC-17, and AC-30.
- [ ] Review the rendered website against the chosen visual references.

Exit: a customer can follow the chosen ordering process, and staff can fulfill the resulting order.

## Phase 7 — Admin overview and complete rehearsal

Depends on: Phases 4–6, adjusted for chosen public scope.

- [ ] Add kitchen workload and remaining alerts to Home. Due today, awaiting confirmation, overdue, balance due, next-7-days, ready for pickup with late collections (5B), missing-routing alert, and setup checklist are done.
- [ ] Validate dashboard counts and dates against underlying order records.
- [ ] Implement the daily sales report with CSV export (AC-35).
- [ ] Complete settings and staff-management screens.
- [ ] Run all Release 1 acceptance scenarios (PRD section 12), including concurrent edits and interrupted connections; run AC-26/AC-27 if selected for launch.
- [ ] Rehearse exceptions using admin overrides: unavailable item, damaged item, late pickup (AC-36).
- [ ] Rehearse a full shift with counter staff and one user in each kitchen on real devices.
- [ ] Verify print output if printing is in scope.
- [ ] Check typical-volume performance and the proposed kitchen-update target.
- [ ] Restore a backup in staging and verify recovered records (AC-20).
- [ ] Prepare operating guidance for order changes, kitchen issues, cancellations, and recovery.

Exit: owner/staff acceptance recorded; blocking defects resolved and known limits documented.

## Phase 8 — Launch preparation and rollout

- [ ] Load verified products, prices, kitchen mappings, hours, policies, and real staff accounts.
- [ ] Confirm domain/hosting and any paid integrations before committing spend.
- [ ] Configure production secrets, backups, monitoring, and staff recovery procedures.
- [ ] Record launch readiness, support ownership, and rollback instructions.
- [ ] Publish when requested and run a controlled end-to-end production order.
- [ ] Observe initial operating shifts and resolve production issues.
- [ ] Review admin-override logs from the first weeks to prioritize Release 1.1 workflows.

## Phase 9 — Release 1.1 operational exceptions

Depends on: Release 1 live and stable. Use override logs to confirm priorities.

- [ ] Implement per-kitchen daily production summary with variant/time grouping and contributing ticket links (AC-21).
- [ ] Implement the itemized packing checklist with revision-driven rechecking (AC-22, full).
- [ ] Implement substitution proposals, customer response evidence, affected-work holds, and approved order revisions (AC-23).
- [ ] Implement quality incidents, usable-quantity adjustments, approved remake tickets, after-sales replacement handover, and waste register (AC-24).
- [ ] Implement late/uncollected flags, manual contact history, hold deadlines, reviewed extensions, and disposition records (AC-25).
- [ ] Verify AC-21 through AC-25, including their interactions with kitchen routing, cancellation, packing, and payments.

## Later backlog — outside the default first release

### Conditional operational modules — timing to be decided

These modules are fully described in PRD section 5E. Move their tasks into the release plan if selected; basic payment records and manual quotes remain part of the first release regardless.

- [ ] Daily reconciliation: define register/shift scope, transaction intervals, opening float, cash movements, expected/count totals, difference review, and audited closing/reopening.
- [ ] Daily reconciliation: implement admin Daily Close after payment records exist; verify deposit timing, refund handling, duplicate interval protection, and AC-26.
- [ ] Bulk/custom specifications: define required fields, reference files, quote versions, customer acceptance, expiry, deposit conditions, and change deadlines.
- [ ] Bulk/custom specifications: implement versioned quote-to-order handling after order revisions exist; verify only accepted specifications release, file access is restricted, and AC-27 passes.

### Deferred integrations and larger features

- [ ] Online payment gateway and automated refunds.
- [ ] Delivery/driver operations and delivery marketplace integrations.
- [ ] Automated customer SMS, email, or WhatsApp notifications.
- [ ] Raw-material inventory, recipes, purchasing, and production batches.
- [ ] Loyalty, promotions, accounts, and advanced reporting.
- [ ] Multiple branches and multi-stage cross-kitchen items.
- [ ] Dedicated printer integration, full offline operation, and automatic capacity planning.

## Tracking conventions

- Use task states: Planned, In Progress, Blocked, Done when assigning work later.
- For a blocked task, record the missing decision/dependency and the next action.
- Add an owner and estimate after business scope and stack are settled; current phases are dependency-based, not a promised schedule.
- Mark implementation tasks complete only with evidence appropriate to the change.
- Update PRD first when a task changes agreed behavior; keep this checklist consistent with it.
